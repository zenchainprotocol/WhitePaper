# Overview 

The cryptocurrency industry is based on a simple premise: people should be fully in control of their finances. While it seems like a simple and obvious statement, the current systems are far from providing financial services that are truly under the control of the people who use them. The mission of ZenChain is to give people (and in the future, machines, and devices) seamless access to decentralized finance (DeFi) with special for non-fungible tokens (NTFs). For that purpose, we are introducing ZenChain, a dedicated blockchain specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) with special for non-fungible tokens (NTFs).

ZenChain approaches decentralized finance as a specific and critical segment of the blockchain community. ZenChain is a dedicated blockchain that is optimized specifically for DeFi and NTF applications. ZenChan does contain all core DeFi applications built in the core of the chain, not written by smart contracts like swap, lending, and insurance dapp. ZenChain also contains all applications supported for NTFs like minting, auctions, and trading. And special, with ZenChain, your NTFs can use it as collateral in Defi to make a loan or staking in a pool to earn extra token â€¦
