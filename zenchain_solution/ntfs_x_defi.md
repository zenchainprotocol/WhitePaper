Or another word, you can imagine NFT-Fi like a loyalty card or coupon.

*   **Interest King:** if a user uses or holds these NFTs when using Defi, users can earn more LP fee in Dex (normal is 0.03%), or users can earn more lending interest, or reduce borrow interest. Each Interest King token has special traits: percent increase or decrease fee, time to use, period, scope of token …
*   **Lucky Pass:** if a user uses or holds these NFTs when using Defi, users can have change to mint more NFT-Fi token … To be fair, ZenChain has Random Number Generator power by Oracle module.
