ZenChain gives some solution to resolve this problem:

- Scalable, high-throughput Blockchain with Tendermint Power

- Bridge from Etherum, Tron, Binance smart chain make cross-chain Defi and NFTs solutions.

- Decentralized pricing oracles built-in

- DeFi primitives built-in: Dex, Lending &amp; Borrowing, token IDO, insurance.

- Non-fungible Token applications like mint, auction, rent NFTs

- NFTs X DEFI: bring the power of NFTs to Defi ecosystem and Defi to NFTs.
